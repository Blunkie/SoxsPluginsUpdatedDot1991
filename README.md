# Soxs Free Plugins Updated

Big Thanks Soxs For Making The Plugins ( https://github.com/Soxs/PluginsRelease/) And To Dot1991 He Updated The AutoLogHop Plugin (https://github.com/dot1991/PluginsSource) And I Just Changed The Const Val And Compileonly to $unethicaliteVersion+ And I Changed The Unethicalite Version To The Newest 1.0.18 Will Change To 1.0.19 Later When The Client Is Back Up.

Still Kind Of Learning So You May Have To Drag The Plugin Into .openosrs/plugins folder till i add in the plugins.json file.
